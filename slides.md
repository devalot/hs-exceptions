# Stupid

<div class="notes">

Haskell is great about forcing programmers to deal with problems at
compile time.  That said, it's still possible to write code which may
not work at runtime.  Especially with *partial* functions.

The function below will throw an exception at runtime if it's given an
empty list.  This is because `head` is a partial function and only
works with non-empty lists.

# Better

<div class="notes">

A better approach is to avoid the use of `head` and pattern match the
list directly.  The function below is *total* since it can handle
lists of any length (including infinite lists).

Of course, if the list or its head is bottom (‚ä•) then this function
will throw an exception when the patterns are evaluated.  We'll talk
about bottom in a bit.

# Reusing Existing Functions

<div class="notes">

This is the version I like most because it reuses existing functions
that are well tested.

The `listToMaybe` function comes with the Haskell Platform.  It takes
a list and returns its head in a `Just`.  If the list is empty it
returns `Nothing`.  Alternatively you can use the `headMay` function
from the [Safe][safe] package.

# Providing Error Messages

<div class="notes">

Another popular type when dealing with failure is `Either` which
allows you to return a value with an error.  It's common to include an
error message using the `Left` constructor.

Beyond `Maybe` and `Either` it's also common to define your own type
that indicates success or failure.  We won't discuss this further.
